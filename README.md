# Tailwind CSS Gradient Misconfiguration Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's gradient feature.  The bug occurs when the gradient configuration is incomplete or incorrect, leading to unexpected visual results.  The solution highlights how to correctly implement Tailwind gradients to avoid this problem. 

## Bug Description

When using Tailwind's `bg-gradient-to-r` utility, along with color values such as `from-blue-500` and `to-purple-500`, an unexpected output may occur if the `to` color value is misconfigured or absent.  The gradient may appear incomplete or not render as expected.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the unexpected gradient rendering.

## Solution

The solution lies in properly defining both the `from` and `to` color values in the gradient utility.  Ensure that you specify valid Tailwind CSS color classes for both.

## How to Fix

1. Review the `bugSolution.html` file for the corrected implementation.
2. Ensure that both `from` and `to` values use correctly defined Tailwind CSS color classes.
